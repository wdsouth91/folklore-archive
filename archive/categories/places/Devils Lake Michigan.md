# Devils Lake Michigan

Situated in southeast Michigan, this lake is in an area also known as Manitou Beach

## The Legend of the Lake

According to local legends, this lake got its name when the local native chief's daughter drowned while trying to meet with her secretive lover. A devil or spirit was said to have come out of the lake and dragged her into it. Not even her body was said to have been found. [^1] 

## Other Legends

There is an underwater cavern in the lake. This area has not been extensively explored but might be a sort of underwater spring.[^2]. 

There have been some rumors of lake monsters that originate from within this underwater cave/cavern and that this was the *devil* from the aforementioned story that dragged the young native princess off. [^Source needed].
