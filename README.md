# folklore-archive
A folklore archive

## Purpose

To create a software and system agnostic database of folkloric research, articles, and materials for either individual research, collaboration, or similar purposes. Maintainers of the project are hereafter referred to as *archivists*. 

## Archive Features

The archive will be updated via the Github *Pull Requests* feature and only those who have authority (Such as archivists) will assess the submissions and then approve or reject them. Corrections or questions should be raised and tracked using the Github *Issues* feature. 

### Journals

Should be completed full-text journals of folklorists and independent researchers. You may submit your own journals to the archive but they must be complete. Numerous updates to individual journal files may be rejected as they would create an unnecessary amount of extra work and updates. Please do not submit incomplete or copyrighted materials. If such content has been erroneously accepted into the archive, please use the issues feature to bring it to our attention, or otherwise email one of the archivists. It will be removed as soon as possible. 

### Articles

Should be complete articles on the subject matter to which they pertain. They should be as clearly edited to the best of your ability (But due to the collaborative nature of the project, corrections can be suggested and applied via Pull Requests). Archivists will attempt to determine the quality and correctness of articles but are not typically experts in all of the fields of the archive. 

### All content

All content should be submitted in the Markdown format, carefully edited, and as correct as possible. If a copy from a different source it should identify that source and the date accessed. If you cite another source, you should include that information as a citation and further expand upon it using footnotes or bibliographies within your document.
